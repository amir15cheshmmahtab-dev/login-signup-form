# User Authentication App (React.js)

## Overview

This project is a modern, single-page application (SPA) built with **React.js** that demonstrates a robust user authentication flow, featuring separate pages for **Sign Up** and **Login**. It includes client-side form validation, state management using React Hooks, and a component-based structure using **React Router DOM** for navigation.

The application uses **CSS Modules** for component-specific styling and **React Toastify** for user feedback on form submission and validation.

‚ú® Key Features

  * **Client-Side Validation:** Real-time form input validation for fields like name, email, password length, and password confirmation.
  * **Routing:** Seamless navigation between the Login and Sign Up pages using **React Router DOM**.
  * **State Management:** Utilizes the `useState` and `useEffect` React Hooks for managing form data, errors, and touch state.
  * **Styled Components:** Uses **CSS Modules** for local scope styling to ensure a clean, maintainable, and modern user interface.
  * **User Feedback:** Implements **React Toastify** to provide clear success or error notifications upon form submission.
  * **Default Route:** The root path (`/`) automatically redirects to the Login page.
